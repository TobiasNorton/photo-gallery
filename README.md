## Description:

- This is a photo gallery of some of my favorite artists I created using the React Router library and a custom JSON file.

- Users can click on an image on the main page and the DOM will update to a photo gallery of that specific artist without having to reload the browser.

- Built with JavaScript, React.js, the React Router library and CSS
