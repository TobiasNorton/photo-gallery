## Description:

- This is a photo gallery of some of my favorite artists I created using the React Router library and a custom JSON file.

- Users can click on an image on the main page and the DOM will update to a photo gallery of that specific artist without having to reload the browser. A photo detail can then be displayed in the same manner by clicking on an image.

### Built with:

- JavaScript - https://www.javascript.com/

- React.js - https://reactjs.org/

- React Router - https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router

- CSS
